This bash script automates the setup of a Jenkins server, integrates it with a GitHub repository, and deploys a Flask app. Here’s an explanation of each step:

1. Update the Package List and Install Required Software
   - `sudo apt update -y`: Updates the list of available packages and their versions.
   - `sudo apt install git python3-pip python3-flask docker.io -y`: Installs Git, Python’s pip package manager, Flask (for web development), and Docker (for containerization).

2. Start Docker
   - `sudo systemctl start docker`: Starts the Docker service to run containers.

3. Clone Jenkins Automation Repository
   - `sudo git clone https://<user_name>... /home/ubuntu/Jenkins_Automation`: Clones the GitHub repository containing Jenkins automation scripts into the `/home/ubuntu/Jenkins_Automation` directory.

4. Add Jenkins Key and Repository
   - `sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc`: Downloads Jenkins' GPG key for package verification.
   - `echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/...`: Adds Jenkins' official Debian repository to the system's package sources list.

5. Install Jenkins
   - `sudo apt-get install -y jenkins`: Installs Jenkins, a widely used automation server for continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).
   - The script checks if Jenkins is installed using a `while` loop with `dpkg -l | grep --quiet jenkins` and attempts to reinstall it if not found.

6. Install Java (OpenJDK 17)
   - `sudo apt-get install -y fontconfig openjdk-17-jre`: Installs Java (OpenJDK 17), required for running Jenkins.

7. Enable and Start Jenkins Service
   - The script ensures that the Jenkins service is enabled to start at boot and starts it using:
     - `sudo systemctl enable jenkins`
     - `sudo systemctl start jenkins`
   - The loop continues checking whether the service is active using `systemctl is-active --quiet jenkins`.

8. Move to Jenkins Automation Folder
   - `cd Jenkins_Automation`: Navigates to the directory where the Jenkins automation scripts are located.

9. Install Jenkins Plugins
   - `bash install_plugins.txt`: Executes a script that installs required Jenkins plugins for the CI/CD pipeline.

10. Wait for Jenkins to Start
   - The script waits 60 seconds in 10-second intervals to allow Jenkins enough time to start fully.

11. Run GitHub Credential Setup
   - `bash create_github_credentials`: Sets up GitHub credentials for Jenkins to access the repositories.

12. Set up Pipeline
   - `bash setup_pipeline`: Configures a Jenkins pipeline for automating builds, tests, and deployments.

13. Create GitHub Webhook
   - `python3 create_github_webhook`: Runs a Python script to create a webhook in GitHub for Jenkins to trigger builds automatically when changes are pushed to the repository.

14. Set Up Jenkins Workspace
   - The script creates a Jenkins workspace directory and provides the necessary permissions:
     - `sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/workspace`: Creates the workspace directory for Jenkins jobs.
     - `sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins`: Changes the ownership of the workspace to Jenkins.
     - `sudo chmod -R 755`: Sets proper permissions to ensure Jenkins can access and manage the workspace files.

15. Clone Flask App
   - `sudo git clone https://<user_name>... /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/flask_app`: Clones the Flask app repository into Jenkins' workspace.

16. Set Permissions for Flask App
   - The script changes the ownership and permissions of the cloned Flask app to allow Jenkins to manage it:
     - `sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/flask_app`
     - `sudo chmod -R 755 /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/flask_app`

17. Start Flask App
   - `python3 flask_app/app.py`: Runs the Flask application by executing the `app.py` file.

Summary:
This script performs a complete Jenkins setup, including installing dependencies, configuring Jenkins, setting up a CI/CD pipeline, and deploying a Flask web application using Jenkins. It also manages permissions for Jenkins to access the necessary files and directories.
